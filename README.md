# Attention-based-CNN-BiLSTM-Battery-SOH-Prediction
Attention-based CNN-BiLSTM for SOH prediction of lithium-ion batteries

This project predicts the life of the Lithium Ion battery with an attention-based-CNN-BiLSTM based on the voltage, current and temperature of the charging cycles. Lithium ion battery data has been taken from NASA Ames Prognostics Data Repository [1]
