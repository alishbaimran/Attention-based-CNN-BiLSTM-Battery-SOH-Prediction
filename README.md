# Attention-based-CNN-BiLSTM-Battery-SOH-Prediction
Attention-based CNN-BiLSTM for SOH prediction of lithium-ion batteries

The state of health (SOH) and remaining useful life (RUL) of lithium-ion batteries are important aspects of a cell chemistry which describe the current aging degree of the batteries from different perspectives. To improve the effectiveness and accuracy of the batteriesâ€™ health assessment models, I've implemented a method for SOH and RUL estimation of lithium-ion batteries using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), and attention mechanism (AM) to build a hybrid network model for capacity estimation of lithium-ion batteries, and calculate the SOH and RUL. 

Specifically, this project predicts the life of the Lithium Ion battery with an attention-based-CNN-BiLSTM based on the voltage, current and temperature of the charging cycles. 

Lithium ion battery data has been taken from NASA Ames Prognostics Data Repository [1]. I've also included a notebook for initial data exploration of this dataset and an SVM model for SOC prediction.
